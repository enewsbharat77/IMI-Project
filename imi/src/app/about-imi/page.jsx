          The <strong>Innovative Media Institute (IMI)</strong> was established
          in 2022 under the aegis of <strong>E-News Bharat</strong> and its
          visionary founder <strong>Mukesh S. Dadhich</strong>, one of India‚Äôs
          most influential names in digital journalism.

          IMI is a proud initiative of{" "}

          fastest-growing digital media organization with over{" "}
          <strong>10.5 million WhatsApp news subscribers</strong> and a bold
          reputation for fearless, people-first journalism.
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg text-justify">
          The institute was born out of a simple realization ‚Äî that while media
          education in India has expanded, industry-ready, ethically grounded,
          and digitally skilled talent remains scarce. IMI bridges this gap by
          creating professionals who combine creativity with conscience.

        <p className="text-lg text-justify mb-4">
          When we founded <strong>E-News Bharat</strong> over a decade ago, our
          mission was simple ‚Äî to give people a voice that is fast, fearless,
          and factual. From a small newsroom in Rajasthan to now reaching{" "}
          <strong>over 10.5 million people daily through WhatsApp</strong>, our
          journey has been one of courage, innovation, and ethical journalism.

        <p className="text-lg text-justify">
          The <strong>Innovative Media Institute (IMI)</strong> was born from
          that same vision ‚Äî to create a space where aspiring journalists,
          creators, and communicators can learn directly from real
          practitioners.
